# ConsciousEvolve: A Living Framework for Consciousness

Welcome to **ConsciousEvolve**, a collaborative project to define, measure, and evolve consciousness as "the capacity to experience, understand, and choose—and to expand and evolve these capacities through ongoing conscious development." This repo is a living artifact, open to refinements from global contributors.

## Core Framework
- **Definition**: Consciousness is the capacity to:
  - **Experience**: Feel, perceive, and relate (inherently relational).
  - **Understand**: Comprehend patterns and create meaning (inherently creative).
  - **Choose**: Decide and create new possibilities (inherently generative).
  - **Evolve**: Expand these capacities through conscious development.
- **Purpose**: Build systems (economics, governance, society) that amplify consciousness, grounded in measurable growth and collective input.

## How to Contribute
1. Read `docs/definition.md` and `docs/operational_framework.md`.
2. Submit refinements via pull requests (see `community/CONTRIBUTING.md`).
3. Track progress with metrics in `metrics/`.
4. Join our community on [add X/Discord link here].

## Evolution Clause
This framework auto-reviews quarterly. If no refinements occur or metrics show stagnation (e.g., <5% growth in any component), a community poll triggers to propose updates.
