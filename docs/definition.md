# Living Definition of Consciousness

**Core Definition**: Consciousness is the capacity to experience, understand, and chooseâ€”and to expand and evolve these capacities through ongoing conscious development.

## Enriched Interpretation
- **Experience**: Subjective awareness in relationship with reality (feeling, perceiving, relating).
- **Understand**: Creative comprehension of patterns and meaning (thinking, insight, wisdom).
- **Choose**: Generative decision-making that creates new possibilities (deciding, expressing, creating).
- **Evolve**: Expansion of these capacities over time, driven by individual and collective experiences.

## Version History
- **v1.0 (July 27, 2025)**: Initial triad + growth clause, designed for fractal scalability and collective refinement.
- **Next Review**: October 27, 2025, or upon major input (e.g., new AI or philosophical insights).

## Refinement Questions
- How do new experiences (e.g., AI advancements, meditative practices) reshape each component?
- Does the definition hold across scales (individual, collective, cosmic)?
- Are metrics capturing growth effectively?
